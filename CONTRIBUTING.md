## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue

Before [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), confirm that a similar issue has not already been reported. If you find a closed issue that seems to be the same as the one you're experiencing, open a new issue and link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

When creating an issue, please provide as much detail as possible. This includes:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots, if applicable
- Any other relevant information

### :lock: Reporting Security Issues

**Do not** file a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please email **support@pipelines.lol**. This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that are found are addressed as quickly as possible. If you are not sure whether you are dealing with a security issue, please err on the side of caution, and report it via email.
